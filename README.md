# Test JAX-RS App

This is just a really simple test application that uses Undertow + Resteasy + Jackson via [Propulsor](https://github.com/Commonjava/propulsor), which helps with the basic setup, booting, etc.

The app itself is just meant to try out different techniques and see how Undertow, Resteasy, and company handle scenarios. I wanted a place the check things without having to create a massive change to an existing application (which could introduce many other complications).
